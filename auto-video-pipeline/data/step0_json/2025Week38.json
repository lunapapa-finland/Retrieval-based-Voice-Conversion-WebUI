      "script": "This week, from September 15th to 19th, our bias remains conservative bullish. What that means is, the odds are still higher for the market to push up toward 6700 from last week’s close around 6488, rather than falling back to test the 6240 zone. Our range focus sits between 6260 and 6460, with key levels marking resistance at 6260 and support at 6460. The big macro event to keep in mind is the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, which always has potential to shake things up. Looking ahead to Monday, the plan is straightforward: if we open with a gap up, we go long at the wedge bottom. If we open with a gap down, we do the same—long at the wedge bottom. So in short, the market has a bullish lean, levels are clear, and Monday’s playbook is set. Now, let’s expand our view and check the bigger picture in the monthly outlook."

      "script": "Let’s step back and look at the monthly chart. The trend is bullish, supported by the presence of both a wedge and a double bottom pattern. At the start of September, the first week closed with a bull bar. That aligns with the weekly chart also printing a bull bar in that same opening week. With three weeks still remaining in the month, the probability is higher that the monthly bar will finish bullish rather than turning into a bear bar. Now, while the larger channel across weekly and daily timeframes is bullish, that doesn’t rule out a minor pullback. Pullbacks are natural pauses inside a trend, and that’s something we need to stay prepared for. One important test already took place: the 6370 level was touched in the first week of September. Bulls will be working hard to prevent a retest of that area. If they succeed, then 6370 should stand as the monthly low for now. In terms of levels to watch, resistance remains at 6460 and support at 6260. So in short, the monthly picture is still bright, with bullish control holding firm and 6370 as the key defensive line. With that backdrop in mind, let’s zoom in a bit further and talk about the weekly outlook."

      "script": "Now narrowing our lens to the weekly view, the message is consistent: the trend is bullish. We again see patterns like the wedge and the double bottom supporting that story. Much like the monthly chart, the first week of September gave us a bull bar. That tells us buyers have momentum in hand, at least for now. But it’s important to recognize that the broader channel across the weekly and daily timeframes suggests the chance for a minor pullback. A pullback in this context would be part of normal price behavior, not a reversal of the trend. Just like in the monthly view, 6370 stands out as a tested and defended level. If bulls maintain control, that line should hold steady as the monthly low. Resistance is marked at 6460, while support is set at 6260. So in short, the weekly picture reinforces the monthly stance: bullish bias, but with an eye out for shallow retracements along the way. With that understanding, let’s bring it even closer and check the daily outlook."

      "script": "On the daily timeframe, the story holds together with the larger views. The trend is bullish, shaped again by the wedge and double bottom structures. Just like we saw on the monthly and weekly scales, the first week of September produced a bull bar. That momentum echoes through to the daily action. Still, when we map the price path, the broader bullish channel hints at the possibility of minor pullbacks. That’s something we need to accommodate without overreacting, because a pullback does not necessarily mean the trend is broken. The 6370 level tested earlier in September remains a key point to defend. If bulls keep the upper hand, that line should hold as the low for the month. The chart also points us to resistance at 6460 and support at 6260. So in short, the daily aligns perfectly with the bigger timeframes, confirming bullish control with some breathing room for pullbacks. With the broad picture in place, let’s turn now to short-term reflections in the five-minute reviews of last week."

      "script": "Looking back at last Monday, one of the good entries we had was tied to the larger theme we’ve been discussing. The close of the first week in September gave us a bull bar, matching the weekly bar, and setting up expectations for continued strength. That alignment offered a solid opportunity to lean into the trend with confidence. So in short, Monday’s review shows that staying aligned with the bigger picture gave us a clear edge. With that lesson in mind, let’s see how Tuesday shaped up."

      "script": "Tuesday’s review also highlighted good entries that connected directly to the broader context. The monthly and weekly charts lined up with a bull bar at the start of September, and that narrative carried weight into the session. This gave us confidence to hold positions aligned with the trend, knowing the probability leaned bullish. So in short, Tuesday reinforced the lesson: stick with the broader bias when intraday setups agree. Now, let’s move on to Wednesday’s review."

      "script": "On Wednesday, the good entries again stemmed from the same repeating theme. The early September bull bar on both the monthly and weekly charts created a strong background for intraday trades. That context gave weight to long entries, even as the market shaped minor pauses. So in short, Wednesday’s review reminds us that consistent patterns across timeframes are valuable guides. Next, let’s turn to Thursday."

      "script": "Thursday carried on the same structure. The good entries we saw tied back to the larger bullish narrative, with the monthly and weekly bull bars lending strong support. Each intraday setup that aligned with that backdrop felt more reliable. So in short, Thursday’s review underscores the benefit of repeating context: when the story is clear, entries become easier to trust. Let’s wrap up with Friday’s review."

      "script": "Finally, last Friday gave us good entries along the same lines as the rest of the week. The start-of-month bull bar remained the guiding signal, and with both monthly and weekly charts aligned, bulls had the stronger case. Trading with that backdrop helped confirm the edge in the intraday setups. So in short, Friday’s review closes out the week with the same consistent message: follow the higher timeframe trend when it aligns, and it pays off. That wraps up our weekly outlook and reviews."
